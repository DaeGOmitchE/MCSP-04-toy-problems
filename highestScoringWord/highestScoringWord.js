// Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
// Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
// You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
// If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
// All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.


// Here are some examples you can try to test your code.
// Input: ‘man i need a taxi up to ubud’ -> Output: ‘taxi’
// Input: ‘what time are we climbing up the volcano’ -> Output: ‘volcano’
// Input: ‘take me to semynak’) -> Output: ‘semynak’
