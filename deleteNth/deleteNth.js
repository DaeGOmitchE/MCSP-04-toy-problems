// Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number 
// of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input 
// is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would
//  lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3,
//   which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3]

//I: given an array and a number
//O: an array of numbers and n for max number of times
//C: 
//E;

// ([4,7,4,12,14,12], 1) since he wants to see each item in the array 
// no more than one time return the array [4,7,12,14]

// ([1,1,3,3,9,5,5,4,1,5], 3) since he wants to see each item in the array 
// no more than three times return[1,1,1,3,3,9,5,5,5]

// Example
//   deleteNth ([1,1,1,1],2) // return [1,1]
//   deleteNth ([20,37,20,21],1) // return [20,37,21]


function deleteNth(arr,n) {
    //make a result array

    //iterate over the array

    //if item appears less than n times 

    //push item to result array
}
