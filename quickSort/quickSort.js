/**
 * Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy;

 * It:
 *    Takes in an array.
 *    Picks a value in the array as a pivot.
 *    Partitions all the elements of the array into two arrays, based on
 *      if they are larger or smaller than the pivot.
 *    Recursively sorts the two halves.
 *    Combines the two arrays and the pivot into a sorted array.
